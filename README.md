# Case-sensitive innerHTML error in Javascript This example demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using innerHTML in Javascript. The error arises from a case-sensitive typo in 'innerHtml', resulting in the code failing silently and producing unexpected results. This is an uncommon error, as most developers are familiar with innerHTML and often use auto-complete, but it highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when writing JavaScript and its interaction with the DOM.
